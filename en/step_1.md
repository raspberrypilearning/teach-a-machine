## What you will make

![The image shows a machine learning interface from "Teachable Machine" where a model is being trained to recognize hand gestures for the numbers "Five" and "Three." On the right, in the "Preview" section, the webcam feed displays a hand showing three fingers. Below this, the "Output" section shows the classification results, with the model predicting a 94% probability for "Three" and a small 6% probability for "Five." The model has successfully identified the hand gesture as "Three."](images/wywm.png)

You will teach a computer to tell you how many fingers you are holding up!

- This project uses a technology called 'machine learning'. Machine learning systems are trained using a large amount of dataï»¿. 
- This project does not require you to create an account or log in. For this project, the image examples you use to make the model are only stored temporarily in your browser (only on your machine).
- No images from your webcam are sent to this website or any other website.
