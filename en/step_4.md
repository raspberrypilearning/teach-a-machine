## What can I do next?

Here are some other examples of image classification.

Why not try your own?

### Bee or Berry?
**TODO** Add bee or berry
![An image of a bee is held up to a web camera. Then an image of a berry. In the output panel underneath the video, the confidence is displayed as to whether a bee or a berry is being shown.](images/bee_or_berry.gif)

### Biscuit or cake?

### Resistor recogniser
**TODO** Add resistor recogniser
![An image of a 12 ohm resistor is held up to a web camera. Then an image of a 330 ohm resistor. In the output panel underneath the video, the confidence is displayed as to whether a 12 ohm or a 330 ohm resistor is being shown.](images/resistor_recogniser.gif)
